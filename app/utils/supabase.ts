In this chapter we discuss the same from the database’s point of view: how we can store the data that we’re given, and how we can find it again when we’re asked for it.",
					"Why should you, as an application developer, care how the database handles storage and retrieval internally? You’re probably not going to implement your own storage engine from scratch, but you *do* need to select a storage engine that is appropriate for your application, from the many that are available. In order to tune a storage engine to perform well on your kind of workload, you need to have a rough idea of what the storage engine is doing under the hood.",
					"In particular, there is a big difference between storage engines that are optimized for transactional workloads and those that are optimized for analytics.

								"These two functions implement a key-value store. You can call `db_set key value`, which will store `key` and `value` in the database. The key and value can be (almost) anything you like—for example, the value could be a JSON document. You can then call `db_get key`, which looks up the most recent value associated with that particular key and returns it.",

								"The underlying storage format is very simple: a text file where each line contains a key-value pair, separated by a comma (roughly like a CSV file, ignoring escaping issues). Every call to `db_set` appends to the end of the file, so if you update a key several times, the old versions of the value are not overwritten—you need to look at the last occurrence of a key in a file to find the latest value (hence the `tail -n 1` in `db_get`):",

								"Our `db_set` function actually has pretty good performance for something that is so simple, because appending to a file is generally very efficient. Similarly to what `db_set` does, many databases internally use a *log*, which is an append-only data file. Real databases have more issues to deal with (such as concurrency control, reclaiming disk space so that the log doesn’t grow forever, and handling errors and partially written records), but the basic principle is the same. Logs are incredibly useful, and we will encounter them several times in the rest of this book.",

								"The word *log* is often used to refer to application logs, where an application outputs text that describes what’s happening. In this book, *log* is used in the more general sense: an append-only sequence of records. It doesn’t have to be human-readable; it might be binary and intended only for other programs to read.",
								"On the other hand, our `db_get` function has terrible performance if you have a large number of records in your database. Every time you want to look up a key, `db_get` has to scan the entire database file from beginning to end, looking for occurrences of the key. In algorithmic terms, the cost of a lookup is *O*(*n*): if you double the number of records *n* in your database, a lookup takes twice as long. That’s not good.",
								"In order to efficiently find the value for a particular key in the database, we need a different data structure: an *index*. In this chapter we will look at a range of indexing structures and see how they compare; the general idea behind them is to keep some additional metadata on the side, which acts as a signpost and helps you to locate the data you want. If you want to search the same data in several different ways, you may need several different indexes on different parts of the data.",
								"An index is an *additional* structure that is derived from the primary data. Many databases allow you to add and remove indexes, and this doesn’t affect the contents of the database; it only affects the performance of queries. Maintaining additional structures incurs overhead, especially on writes. For writes, it’s hard to beat the performance of simply appending to a file, because that’s the simplest possible write operation. Any kind of index usually slows down writes, because the index also needs to be updated every time data is written.",
								"This is an important trade-off in storage systems: well-chosen indexes speed up read queries, but every index slows down writes. For this reason, databases don’t usually index everything by default, but require you—the application developer or database administrator—to choose indexes manually, using your knowledge of the application’s typical query patterns. You can then choose the indexes that give your application the greatest benefit, without introducing more overhead than necessary.",

Hash maps are described in many algorithms textbooks \\[[1](), [2]()\\], so we won’t go into detail of how they work here. Since we already have hash maps for our in-memory data structures, why not use them to index our data on disk?",
											"Let’s say our data storage consists only of appending to a file, as in the preceding example. Then the simplest possible indexing strategy is this: keep an in-memory hash map where every key is mapped to a byte offset in the data file—the location at which the value can be found, as illustrated in [Figure 3-1](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#fig_storage_csv_hash_index). Whenever you append a new key-value pair to the file, you also update the hash map to reflect the offset of the data you just wrote (this works both for inserting new keys and for updating existing keys). When you want to look up a value, use the hash map to find the offset in the data file, seek to that location, and read the value.",

Bitcask offers high-performance reads and writes, subject to the requirement that all the keys fit in the available RAM, since the hash map is kept completely in memory. The values can use more space than there is available memory, since they can be loaded from disk with just one disk seek. If that part of the data file is already in the filesystem cache, a read doesn’t require any disk I/O at all.",
											"A storage engine like Bitcask is well suited to situations where the value for each key is updated frequently. For example, the key might be the URL of a cat video, and the value might be the number of times it has been played (incremented every time someone hits the play button). In this kind of workload, there are a lot of writes, but there are not too many distinct keys—you have a large number of writes per key, but it’s feasible to keep all keys in memory.",
											"As described so far, we only ever append to a file—so how do we avoid eventually running out of disk space? A good solution is to break the log into segments of a certain size by closing a segment file when it reaches a certain size, and making subsequent writes to a new segment file. We can then perform *compaction* on these segments, as illustrated in [Figure 3-2](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#fig_storage_compaction).

Segments are never modified after they have been written, so the merged segment is written to a new file. The merging and compaction of frozen segments can be done in a background thread, and while it is going on, we can still continue to serve read and write requests as normal, using the old segment files. After the merging process is complete, we switch read requests to using the new merged segment instead of the old segments—and then the old segment files can simply be deleted.",

											"If the database is restarted, the in-memory hash maps are lost. In principle, you can restore each segment’s hash map by reading the entire segment file from beginning to end and noting the offset of the most recent value for every key as you go along. However, that might take a long time if the segment files are large, which would make server restarts painful. Bitcask speeds up recovery by storing a snapshot of each segment’s hash map on disk, which can be loaded into memory more quickly.",

However, you do know the offsets for the keys *handbag* and *handsome*, and because of the sorting you know that *handiwork* must appear between those two.

Since read requests need to scan over several key-value pairs in the requested range anyway, it is possible to group those records into a block and compress it before writing it to disk (indicated by the shaded area in [Figure 3-5](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#fig_storage_sstable_index)).

There are plenty of well-known tree data structures that you can use, such as red-black trees or AVL trees \\[[2]()\\]. With these data structures, you can insert keys in any order and read them back in sorted order.",
											"We can now make our storage engine work as follows:",
											"* When a write comes in, add it to an in-memory balanced tree data structure (for example, a red-black tree). This in-memory tree is sometimes called a *memtable*.",
											"* When the memtable gets bigger than some threshold—typically a few megabytes—write it out to disk as an SSTable file. This can be done efficiently because the tree already maintains the key-value pairs sorted by key. The new SSTable file becomes the most recent segment of the database. While the SSTable is being written out to disk, writes can continue to a new memtable instance.",
											"* In order to serve a read request, first try to find the key in the memtable, then in the most recent on-disk segment, then in the next-older segment, etc.",
											"* From time to time, run a merging and compaction process in the background to combine segment files and to discard overwritten or deleted values.",
											"This scheme works very well. It only suffers from one problem: if the database crashes, the most recent writes (which are in the memtable but not yet written out to disk) are lost. In order to avoid that problem, we can keep a separate log on disk to which every write is immediately appended, just like in the previous section. That log is not in sorted order, but that doesn’t matter, because its only purpose is to restore the memtable after a crash. Every time the memtable is written out to an SSTable, the corresponding log can be discarded.",
											"### **Making an LSM-tree out of SSTables**",
											"The algorithm described here is essentially what is used in LevelDB \\[[6]()\\] and RocksDB \\[[7]()\\], key-value storage engine libraries that are designed to be embedded into other applications. Among other things, LevelDB can be used in Riak as an alternative to Bitcask. Similar storage engines are used in Cassandra and HBase \\[[8]()\\], both of which were inspired by Google’s Bigtable paper \\[[9]()\\] (which introduced the terms *SSTable* and *memtable*).",
											"Originally this indexing structure was described by Patrick O’Neil et al. under the name *Log-Structured Merge-Tree* (or LSM-Tree) \\[[10]()\\], building on earlier work on log-structured filesystems \\[[11]()\\]. Storage engines that are based on this principle of merging and compacting sorted files are often called LSM storage engines.",
											"Lucene, an indexing engine for full-text search used by Elasticsearch and Solr, uses a similar method for storing its *term dictionary* \\[[12](), [13]()\\]. A full-text index is much more complex than a key-value index but is based on a similar idea: given a word in a search query, find all the documents (web pages, product descriptions, etc.) that mention the word. This is implemented with a key-value structure where the key is a word (a *term*) and the value is the list of IDs of all the documents that contain the word (the *postings list*). In Lucene, this mapping from term to postings list is kept in SSTable-like sorted files, which are merged in the background as needed \\[[14]()\\].",
											"### **Performance optimizations**",
											"As always, a lot of detail goes into making a storage engine perform well in practice. For example, the LSM-tree algorithm can be slow when looking up keys that do not exist in the database: you have to check the memtable, then the segments all the way back to the oldest (possibly having to read from disk for each one) before you can be sure that the key does not exist. In order to optimize this kind of access, storage engines often use additional *Bloom filters* \\[[15]()\\]. (A Bloom filter is a memory-efficient data structure for approximating the contents of a set. It can tell you if a key does not appear in the database, and thus saves many unnecessary disk reads for nonexistent keys.)",
											"There are also different strategies to determine the order and timing of how SSTables are compacted and merged. The most common options are *size-tiered* and *leveled* compaction. LevelDB and RocksDB use leveled compaction (hence the name of LevelDB), HBase uses size-tiered, and Cassandra supports both \\[[16]()\\]. In size-tiered compaction, newer and smaller SSTables are successively merged into older and larger SSTables. In leveled compaction, the key range is split up into smaller SSTables and older data is moved into separate “levels,” which allows the compaction to proceed more incrementally and use less disk space.",
											"Even though there are many subtleties, the basic idea of LSM-trees—keeping a cascade of SSTables that are merged in the background—is simple and effective. Even when the dataset is much bigger than the available memory it continues to work well. Since data is stored in sorted order, you can efficiently perform range queries (scanning all keys above some minimum and up to some maximum), and because the disk writes are sequential the LSM-tree can support remarkably high write throughput.",
										],
										initial:
											"SSTables (Sorted String Tables) enhance log-structured storage by sorting key-value pairs, allowing efficient merging via a mergesort-like algorithm, a sparse in-memory index for quick access, and block compression to save disk space. Random writes go to an in-memory balanced tree (memtable), which flushes to disk as an SSTable when full. Reads check the memtable first, then older segments, with background merging and compaction. Separate write logging prevents data loss. This LSM-Tree approach, used in LevelDB, RocksDB, Cassandra, and HBase, supports high write throughput and efficient range queries, aided by Bloom filters and compaction strategies.",

Plus, they use a sparse in-memory index, which is just a fancy way of saying you get fast access without hogging memory. And, of course, they compress blocks to save that precious disk space.",
											"Now, what happens when you write data? It first goes to an in-memory balanced tree called a memtable. Think of it as a waiting room for data. Once it’s full, the memtable flushes everything to disk as an SSTable. When you need to read data, the system checks the memtable first, then goes through older segments if necessary. Meanwhile, in the background, the system is busy merging and compacting these segments, keeping everything efficient and tidy.",
											"But wait, there's more! To prevent data loss, there's a separate write log. This is crucial because, without it, you'd risk losing data if something goes wrong. This whole approach is known as the LSM-Tree, short for Log-Structured Merge-Tree. It's the backbone of databases like LevelDB, RocksDB, Cassandra, and HBase, offering high write throughput and super-efficient range queries.",
											"And let's not forget the Bloom filters and compaction strategies. Bloom filters help quickly determine if a key might exist in the database, saving time on unnecessary searches. Compaction strategies, on the other hand, ensure that data remains in optimal shape for fast access. Together, they make sure your data operations are as smooth as a well-oiled machine.",

											"The log-structured indexes we have discussed so far are gaining acceptance, but they are not the most common type of index. The most widely used indexing structure is quite different: the *B-tree*.",
											"Introduced in 1970 \\[[17]()\\] and called “ubiquitous” less than 10 years later \\[[18]()\\], B-trees have stood the test of time very well. They remain the standard index implementation in almost all relational databases, and many nonrelational databases use them too.",
											"Like SSTables, B-trees keep key-value pairs sorted by key, which allows efficient key-value lookups and range queries. But that’s where the similarity ends: B-trees have a very different design philosophy.",
											"The log-structured indexes we saw earlier break the database down into variable-size *segments*, typically several megabytes or more in size, and always write a segment sequentially. By contrast, B-trees break the database down into fixed-size *blocks* or *pages*, traditionally 4 KB in size (sometimes bigger), and read or write one page at a time. This design corresponds more closely to the underlying hardware, as disks are also arranged in fixed-size blocks.",
											"Each page can be identified using an address or location, which allows one page to refer to another—similar to a pointer, but on disk instead of in memory. We can use these page references to construct a tree of pages, as illustrated in [Figure 3-6](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#fig_storage_b_tree).",

											"###### *Figure 3-6. Looking up a key using a B-tree index.*",
											"One page is designated as the *root* of the B-tree; whenever you want to look up a key in the index, you start here. The page contains several keys and references to child pages. Each child is responsible for a continuous range of keys, and the keys between the references indicate where the boundaries between those ranges lie.",
											"In the example in [Figure 3-6](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#fig_storage_b_tree), we are looking for the key 251, so we know that we need to follow the page reference between the boundaries 200 and 300. That takes us to a similar-looking page that further breaks down the 200–300 range into subranges. Eventually we get down to a page containing individual keys (a *leaf page*), which either contains the value for each key inline or contains references to the pages where the values can be found.",
											"The number of references to child pages in one page of the B-tree is called the *branching factor*. For example, in [Figure 3-6](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#fig_storage_b_tree) the branching factor is six. In practice, the branching factor depends on the amount of space required to store the page references and the range boundaries, but typically it is several hundred.",
											"If you want to update the value for an existing key in a B-tree, you search for the leaf page containing that key, change the value in that page, and write the page back to disk (any references to that page remain valid). If you want to add a new key, you need to find the page whose range encompasses the new key and add it to that page. If there isn’t enough free space in the page to accommodate the new key, it is split into two half-full pages, and the parent page is updated to account for the new subdivision of key ranges—see [Figure 3-7](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#fig_storage_b_tree_split).[ii]()",

											"###### *Figure 3-7. Growing a B-tree by splitting a page.*",
											"This algorithm ensures that the tree remains *balanced*: a B-tree with *n* keys always has a depth of *O*(log *n*). Most databases can fit into a B-tree that is three or four levels deep, so you don’t need to follow many page references to find the page you are looking for. (A four-level tree of 4 KB pages with a branching factor of 500 can store up to 256 TB.)",
											"### **Making B-trees reliable**",
											"The basic underlying write operation of a B-tree is to overwrite a page on disk with new data. It is assumed that the overwrite does not change the location of the page; i.e., all references to that page remain intact when the page is overwritten. This is in stark contrast to log-structured indexes such as LSM-trees, which only append to files (and eventually delete obsolete files) but never modify files in place.",
											"You can think of overwriting a page on disk as an actual hardware operation. On a magnetic hard drive, this means moving the disk head to the right place, waiting for the right position on the spinning platter to come around, and then overwriting the appropriate sector with new data. On SSDs, what happens is somewhat more complicated, due to the fact that an SSD must erase and rewrite fairly large blocks of a storage chip at a time \\[[19]()\\].",
											"Moreover, some operations require several different pages to be overwritten. For example, if you split a page because an insertion caused it to be overfull, you need to write the two pages that were split, and also overwrite their parent page to update the references to the two child pages. This is a dangerous operation, because if the database crashes after only some of the pages have been written, you end up with a corrupted index (e.g., there may be an *orphan* page that is not a child of any parent).",
											"In order to make the database resilient to crashes, it is common for B-tree implementations to include an additional data structure on disk: a *write-ahead log* (WAL, also known as a *redo log*). This is an append-only file to which every B-tree modification must be written before it can be applied to the pages of the tree itself. When the database comes back up after a crash, this log is used to restore the B-tree back to a consistent state \\[[5](), [20]()\\].",
											"An additional complication of updating pages in place is that careful concurrency control is required if multiple threads are going to access the B-tree at the same time—otherwise a thread may see the tree in an inconsistent state. This is typically done by protecting the tree’s data structures with *latches* (lightweight locks). Log-structured approaches are simpler in this regard, because they do all the merging in the background without interfering with incoming queries and atomically swap old segments for new segments from time to time.",
											"### **B-tree optimizations**",
											"As B-trees have been around for so long, it’s not surprising that many optimizations have been developed over the years. To mention just a few:",
											"* Instead of overwriting pages and maintaining a WAL for crash recovery, some databases (like LMDB) use a copy-on-write scheme \\[[21]()\\]. A modified page is written to a different location, and a new version of the parent pages in the tree is created, pointing at the new location. This approach is also useful for concurrency control, as we shall see in [“Snapshot Isolation and Repeatable Read”]().",
											"* We can save space in pages by not storing the entire key, but abbreviating it. Especially in pages on the interior of the tree, keys only need to provide enough information to act as boundaries between key ranges. Packing more keys into a page allows the tree to have a higher branching factor, and thus fewer levels.[iii]()",
											"* In general, pages can be positioned anywhere on disk; there is nothing requiring pages with nearby key ranges to be nearby on disk. If a query needs to scan over a large part of the key range in sorted order, that page-by-page layout can be inefficient, because a disk seek may be required for every page that is read. Many B-tree implementations therefore try to lay out the tree so that leaf pages appear in sequential order on disk. However, it’s difficult to maintain that order as the tree grows. By contrast, since LSM-trees rewrite large segments of the storage in one go during merging, it’s easier for them to keep sequential keys close to each other on disk.",
											"* Additional pointers have been added to the tree. For example, each leaf page may have references to its sibling pages to the left and right, which allows scanning keys in order without jumping back to parent pages.",
											"* B-tree variants such as *fractal trees* \\[[22]()\\] borrow some log-structured ideas to reduce disk seeks (and they have nothing to do with fractals).",

											"B-trees, introduced in 1970, are the standard for database indexing due to their efficient key-value sorting and robust structure. They use fixed-size blocks (usually 4 KB) that align with hardware, forming a tree where each page contains keys and child references. Lookups start at the root, navigating to the desired leaf page. B-trees maintain balance with a depth of O(log n) and typically span three or four levels. Updates may involve page splits, with a write-ahead log ensuring data integrity. Concurrency is managed with lightweight locks, and optimizations like copy-on-write and key abbreviation enhance performance.",

When you want to find something, you start at the root and navigate your way down to the leaf page where your data lives.",

Typically, they only go three or four levels deep, so you're never on a wild goose chase. When you need to update, things might get a bit wild with page splits. But fear not! A write-ahead log is there to ensure data integrity, keeping your data safe and sound.",

											"## **Comparing B-Trees and LSM-Trees**",
										],
										children: [
											"Even though B-tree implementations are generally more mature than LSM-tree implementations, LSM-trees are also interesting due to their performance characteristics. As a rule of thumb, LSM-trees are typically faster for writes, whereas B-trees are thought to be faster for reads \\[[23]()\\]. Reads are typically slower on LSM-trees because they have to check several different data structures and SSTables at different stages of compaction.",
											"However, benchmarks are often inconclusive and sensitive to details of the workload. You need to test systems with your particular workload in order to make a valid comparison. In this section we will briefly discuss a few things that are worth considering when measuring the performance of a storage engine.",
											"### **Advantages of LSM-trees**",
											"A B-tree index must write every piece of data at least twice: once to the write-ahead log, and once to the tree page itself (and perhaps again as pages are split). There is also overhead from having to write an entire page at a time, even if only a few bytes in that page changed. Some storage engines even overwrite the same page twice in order to avoid ending up with a partially updated page in the event of a power failure \\[[24](), [25]()\\].",
											"Log-structured indexes also rewrite data multiple times due to repeated compaction and merging of SSTables. This effect—one write to the database resulting in multiple writes to the disk over the course of the database’s lifetime—is known as *write amplification*. It is of particular concern on SSDs, which can only overwrite blocks a limited number of times before wearing out.",
											"In write-heavy applications, the performance bottleneck might be the rate at which the database can write to disk. In this case, write amplification has a direct performance cost: the more that a storage engine writes to disk, the fewer writes per second it can handle within the available disk bandwidth.",
											"Moreover, LSM-trees are typically able to sustain higher write throughput than B-trees, partly because they sometimes have lower write amplification (although this depends on the storage engine configuration and workload), and partly because they sequentially write compact SSTable files rather than having to overwrite several pages in the tree \\[[26]()\\]. This difference is particularly important on magnetic hard drives, where sequential writes are much faster than random writes.",
											"LSM-trees can be compressed better, and thus often produce smaller files on disk than B-trees. B-tree storage engines leave some disk space unused due to fragmentation: when a page is split or when a row cannot fit into an existing page, some space in a page remains unused. Since LSM-trees are not page-oriented and periodically rewrite SSTables to remove fragmentation, they have lower storage overheads, especially when using leveled compaction \\[[27]()\\].",
											"On many SSDs, the firmware internally uses a log-structured algorithm to turn random writes into sequential writes on the underlying storage chips, so the impact of the storage engine’s write pattern is less pronounced \\[[19]()\\]. However, lower write amplification and reduced fragmentation are still advantageous on SSDs: representing data more compactly allows more read and write requests within the available I/O bandwidth.",
											"### **Downsides of LSM-trees**",
											"A downside of log-structured storage is that the compaction process can sometimes interfere with the performance of ongoing reads and writes. Even though storage engines try to perform compaction incrementally and without affecting concurrent access, disks have limited resources, so it can easily happen that a request needs to wait while the disk finishes an expensive compaction operation. The impact on throughput and average response time is usually small, but at higher percentiles (see [“Describing Performance”]()) the response time of queries to log-structured storage engines can sometimes be quite high, and B-trees can be more predictable \\[[28]()\\].",
											"Another issue with compaction arises at high write throughput: the disk’s finite write bandwidth needs to be shared between the initial write (logging and flushing a memtable to disk) and the compaction threads running in the background. When writing to an empty database, the full disk bandwidth can be used for the initial write, but the bigger the database gets, the more disk bandwidth is required for compaction.",
											"If write throughput is high and compaction is not configured carefully, it can happen that compaction cannot keep up with the rate of incoming writes. In this case, the number of unmerged segments on disk keeps growing until you run out of disk space, and reads also slow down because they need to check more segment files. Typically, SSTable-based storage engines do not throttle the rate of incoming writes, even if compaction cannot keep up, so you need explicit monitoring to detect this situation \\[[29](), [30]()\\].",
											"An advantage of B-trees is that each key exists in exactly one place in the index, whereas a log-structured storage engine may have multiple copies of the same key in different segments. This aspect makes B-trees attractive in databases that want to offer strong transactional semantics: in many relational databases, transaction isolation is implemented using locks on ranges of keys, and in a B-tree index, those locks can be directly attached to the tree \\[[5]()\\]. In [Chapter 7]() we will discuss this point in more detail.",
											"B-trees are very ingrained in the architecture of databases and provide consistently good performance for many workloads, so it’s unlikely that they will go away anytime soon. In new datastores, log-structured indexes are becoming increasingly popular. There is no quick and easy rule for determining which type of storage engine is better for your use case, so it is worth testing empirically.",
										],
										initial:
											"LSM-trees generally excel in write performance, offering advantages like lower write amplification, higher write throughput, better compression, and reduced storage overhead. However, they face challenges such as performance interference from compaction and potential disk space issues at high write volumes. B-trees, on the other hand, provide consistently good read performance and transactional benefits, as each key exists in a single location. While B-trees are well-established in database architecture, LSM-trees are gaining popularity in new datastores. The choice between them depends on specific use cases and requires empirical testing to determine the optimal solution.",

											"But, hold your horses! LSM-trees aren't perfect. They can stumble when compaction—the process of merging data—interferes with performance. Plus, if you're dealing with a flood of data, you might hit some disk space issues.",

										heading: [
											"## **Other Indexing Structures**",
										],
										children: [
											"So far we have only discussed key-value indexes, which are like a *primary key* index in the relational model. A primary key uniquely identifies one row in a relational table, or one document in a document database, or one vertex in a graph database. Other records in the database can refer to that row/document/vertex by its primary key (or ID), and the index is used to resolve such references.",
											"It is also very common to have *secondary indexes*. In relational databases, you can create several secondary indexes on the same table using the `CREATE INDEX` command, and they are often crucial for performing joins efficiently. For example, in [Figure 2-1]() in [Chapter 2]() you would most likely have a secondary index on the `user_id` columns so that you can find all the rows belonging to the same user in each of the tables.",
											"A secondary index can easily be constructed from a key-value index. The main difference is that keys are not unique; i.e., there might be many rows (documents, vertices) with the same key. This can be solved in two ways: either by making each value in the index a list of matching row identifiers (like a postings list in a full-text index) or by making each key unique by appending a row identifier to it. Either way, both B-trees and log-structured indexes can be used as secondary indexes.",
											"### **Storing values within the index**",
											"The key in an index is the thing that queries search for, but the value can be one of two things: it could be the actual row (document, vertex) in question, or it could be a reference to the row stored elsewhere. In the latter case, the place where rows are stored is known as a *heap file*, and it stores data in no particular order (it may be append-only, or it may keep track of deleted rows in order to overwrite them with new data later). The heap file approach is common because it avoids duplicating data when multiple secondary indexes are present: each index just references a location in the heap file, and the actual data is kept in one place.",
											"When updating a value without changing the key, the heap file approach can be quite efficient: the record can be overwritten in place, provided that the new value is not larger than the old value. The situation is more complicated if the new value is larger, as it probably needs to be moved to a new location in the heap where there is enough space. In that case, either all indexes need to be updated to point at the new heap location of the record, or a forwarding pointer is left behind in the old heap location \\[[5]()\\].",
											"In some situations, the extra hop from the index to the heap file is too much of a performance penalty for reads, so it can be desirable to store the indexed row directly within an index. This is known as a *clustered index*. For example, in MySQL’s InnoDB storage engine, the primary key of a table is always a clustered index, and secondary indexes refer to the primary key (rather than a heap file location) \\[[31]()\\]. In SQL Server, you can specify one clustered index per table \\[[32]()\\].",
											"A compromise between a clustered index (storing all row data within the index) and a nonclustered index (storing only references to the data within the index) is known as a *covering index* or *index with included columns*, which stores *some* of a table’s columns within the index \\[[33]()\\]. This allows some queries to be answered by using the index alone (in which case, the index is said to *cover* the query) \\[[32]()\\].",
											"As with any kind of duplication of data, clustered and covering indexes can speed up reads, but they require additional storage and can add overhead on writes. Databases also need to go to additional effort to enforce transactional guarantees, because applications should not see inconsistencies due to the duplication.",
											"### **Multi-column indexes**",
											"The indexes discussed so far only map a single key to a value. That is not sufficient if we need to query multiple columns of a table (or multiple fields in a document) simultaneously.",
											"The most common type of multi-column index is called a *concatenated index*, which simply combines several fields into one key by appending one column to another (the index definition specifies in which order the fields are concatenated). This is like an old-fashioned paper phone book, which provides an index from (*lastname*, *firstname*) to phone number. Due to the sort order, the index can be used to find all the people with a particular last name, or all the people with a particular *lastname-firstname* combination. However, the index is useless if you want to find all the people with a particular first name.",
											"Multi-dimensional indexes are a more general way of querying several columns at once, which is particularly important for geospatial data. For example, a restaurant-search website may have a database containing the latitude and longitude of each restaurant. When a user is looking at the restaurants on a map, the website needs to search for all the restaurants within the rectangular map area that the user is currently viewing. This requires a two-dimensional range query like the following:",
											"```\nSELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE latitude  > 51.4946 AND latitude  < 51.5079\n                            AND longitude > -0.1162 AND longitude < -0.1004;\n```",
											"A standard B-tree or LSM-tree index is not able to answer that kind of query efficiently: it can give you either all the restaurants in a range of latitudes (but at any longitude), or all the restaurants in a range of longitudes (but anywhere between the North and South poles), but not both simultaneously.",
											"One option is to translate a two-dimensional location into a single number using a space-filling curve, and then to use a regular B-tree index \\[[34]()\\]. More commonly, specialized spatial indexes such as R-trees are used. For example, PostGIS implements geospatial indexes as R-trees using PostgreSQL’s Generalized Search Tree indexing facility \\[[35]()\\]. We don’t have space to describe R-trees in detail here, but there is plenty of literature on them.",
											"An interesting idea is that multi-dimensional indexes are not just for geographic locations. For example, on an ecommerce website you could use a three-dimensional index on the dimensions (*red*, *green*, *blue*) to search for products in a certain range of colors, or in a database of weather observations you could have a two-dimensional index on (*date*, *temperature*) in order to efficiently search for all the observations during the year 2013 where the temperature was between 25 and 30℃. With a one-dimensional index, you would have to either scan over all the records from 2013 (regardless of temperature) and then filter them by temperature, or vice versa. A 2D index could narrow down by timestamp and temperature simultaneously. This technique is used by HyperDex \\[[36]()\\].",
											"### **Full-text search and fuzzy indexes**",
											"All the indexes discussed so far assume that you have exact data and allow you to query for exact values of a key, or a range of values of a key with a sort order. What they don’t allow you to do is search for *similar* keys, such as misspelled words. Such *fuzzy* querying requires different techniques.",
											"For example, full-text search engines commonly allow a search for one word to be expanded to include synonyms of the word, to ignore grammatical variations of words, and to search for occurrences of words near each other in the same document, and support various other features that depend on linguistic analysis of the text. To cope with typos in documents or queries, Lucene is able to search text for words within a certain edit distance (an edit distance of 1 means that one letter has been added, removed, or replaced) \\[[37]()\\].",
											"As mentioned in [“Making an LSM-tree out of SSTables”](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#sec_storage_lsm_usage), Lucene uses a SSTable-like structure for its term dictionary. This structure requires a small in-memory index that tells queries at which offset in the sorted file they need to look for a key. In LevelDB, this in-memory index is a sparse collection of some of the keys, but in Lucene, the in-memory index is a finite state automaton over the characters in the keys, similar to a *trie* \\[[38]()\\]. This automaton can be transformed into a *Levenshtein automaton*, which supports efficient search for words within a given edit distance \\[[39]()\\].",
											"Other fuzzy search techniques go in the direction of document classification and machine learning. See an information retrieval textbook for more detail \\[e.g., [40]()\\].",
											"### **Keeping everything in memory**",
											"The data structures discussed so far in this chapter have all been answers to the limitations of disks. Compared to main memory, disks are awkward to deal with. With both magnetic disks and SSDs, data on disk needs to be laid out carefully if you want good performance on reads and writes. However, we tolerate this awkwardness because disks have two significant advantages: they are durable (their contents are not lost if the power is turned off), and they have a lower cost per gigabyte than RAM.",
											"As RAM becomes cheaper, the cost-per-gigabyte argument is eroded. Many datasets are simply not that big, so it’s quite feasible to keep them entirely in memory, potentially distributed across several machines. This has led to the development of *in-memory databases*.",
											"Some in-memory key-value stores, such as Memcached, are intended for caching use only, where it’s acceptable for data to be lost if a machine is restarted. But other in-memory databases aim for durability, which can be achieved with special hardware (such as battery-powered RAM), by writing a log of changes to disk, by writing periodic snapshots to disk, or by replicating the in-memory state to other machines.",
											"When an in-memory database is restarted, it needs to reload its state, either from disk or over the network from a replica (unless special hardware is used). Despite writing to disk, it’s still an in-memory database, because the disk is merely used as an append-only log for durability, and reads are served entirely from memory. Writing to disk also has operational advantages: files on disk can easily be backed up, inspected, and analyzed by external utilities.",
											"Products such as VoltDB, MemSQL, and Oracle TimesTen are in-memory databases with a relational model, and the vendors claim that they can offer big performance improvements by removing all the overheads associated with managing on-disk data structures \\[[41](), [42]()\\]. RAMCloud is an open source, in-memory key-value store with durability (using a log-structured approach for the data in memory as well as the data on disk) \\[[43]()\\]. Redis and Couchbase provide weak durability by writing to disk asynchronously.",
											"Counterintuitively, the performance advantage of in-memory databases is not due to the fact that they don’t need to read from disk. Even a disk-based storage engine may never need to read from disk if you have enough memory, because the operating system caches recently used disk blocks in memory anyway. Rather, they can be faster because they can avoid the overheads of encoding in-memory data structures in a form that can be written to disk \\[[44]()\\].",
											"Besides performance, another interesting area for in-memory databases is providing data models that are difficult to implement with disk-based indexes. For example, Redis offers a database-like interface to various data structures such as priority queues and sets. Because it keeps all data in memory, its implementation is comparatively simple.",
											"Recent research indicates that an in-memory database architecture could be extended to support datasets larger than the available memory, without bringing back the overheads of a disk-centric architecture \\[[45]()\\]. The so-called *anti-caching* approach works by evicting the least recently used data from memory to disk when there is not enough memory, and loading it back into memory when it is accessed again in the future. This is similar to what operating systems do with virtual memory and swap files, but the database can manage memory more efficiently than the OS, as it can work at the granularity of individual records rather than entire memory pages. This approach still requires indexes to fit entirely in memory, though (like the Bitcask example at the beginning of the chapter).",
											"Further changes to storage engine design will probably be needed if *non-volatile memory* (NVM) technologies become more widely adopted \\[[46]()\\]. At present, this is a new area of research, but it is worth keeping an eye on in the future.",

								"###### **Note**",
								"A transaction needn’t necessarily have ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) properties. *Transaction processing* just means allowing clients to make low-latency reads and writes—as opposed to *batch processing* jobs, which only run periodically (for example, once per day). We discuss the ACID properties in [Chapter 7]() and batch processing in [Chapter 10]().",
								"Even though databases started being used for many different kinds of data—comments on blog posts, actions in a game, contacts in an address book, etc.—the basic access pattern remained similar to processing business transactions. An application typically looks up a small number of records by some key, using an index. Records are inserted or updated based on the user’s input. Because these applications are interactive, the access pattern became known as *online transaction processing* (OLTP).",
								"However, databases also started being increasingly used for *data analytics*, which has very different access patterns. Usually an analytic query needs to scan over a huge number of records, only reading a few columns per record, and calculates aggregate statistics (such as count, sum, or average) rather than returning the raw data to the user. For example, if your data is a table of sales transactions, then analytic queries might be:",
								"* What was the total revenue of each of our stores in January?",
								"* How many more bananas than usual did we sell during our latest promotion?",
								"* Which brand of baby food is most often purchased together with brand X diapers?",
								"These queries are often written by business analysts, and feed into reports that help the management of a company make better decisions (*business intelligence*). In order to differentiate this pattern of using databases from transaction processing, it has been called *online analytic processing* (OLAP) \\[[47]()\\].[iv]() The difference between OLTP and OLAP is not always clear-cut, but some typical characteristics are listed in [Table 3-1](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#tab_oltp_vs_olap).",

SQL turned out to be quite flexible in this regard: it works well for OLTP-type queries as well as OLAP-type queries. Nevertheless, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a trend for companies to stop using their OLTP systems for analytics purposes, and to run the analytics on a separate database instead.

											"These OLTP systems are usually expected to be highly available and to process transactions with low latency, since they are often critical to the operation of the business. Database administrators therefore closely guard their OLTP databases.

This process of getting data into the warehouse is known as *Extract–Transform–Load* (ETL) and is illustrated in [Figure 3-8](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#fig_dwh_etl).",

In a large company, a lot of heavy lifting is required to do something that is simple in a small company.",

For example, the query engine can take a chunk of compressed column data that fits comfortably in the CPU’s L1 cache and iterate through it in a tight loop (that is, with no function calls). A CPU can execute such a loop much faster than code that requires a lot of function calls and conditions for each record that is processed. Column compression allows more rows from a column to fit in the same amount of L1 cache. Operators, such as the bitwise *AND* and *OR* described previously, can be designed to operate on such chunks of compressed column data directly. This technique is known as *vectorized processing* \\[[58](), [49]()\\].",

											"In a column store, it doesn’t necessarily matter in which order the rows are stored. It’s easiest to store them in the order in which they were inserted, since then inserting a new row just means appending to each of the column files. However, we can choose to impose an order, like we did with SSTables previously, and use that as an indexing mechanism.",
											"Note that it wouldn’t make sense to sort each column independently, because then we would no longer know which items in the columns belong to the same row. We can only reconstruct a row because we know that the *k*th item in one column belongs to the same row as the *k*th item in another column.",
											"Rather, the data needs to be sorted an entire row at a time, even though it is stored by column. The administrator of the database can choose the columns by which the table should be sorted, using their knowledge of common queries. For example, if queries often target date ranges, such as the last month, it might make sense to make `date_key` the first sort key. Then the query optimizer can scan only the rows from the last month, which will be much faster than scanning all rows.",
											"A second column can determine the sort order of any rows that have the same value in the first column. For example, if `date_key` is the first sort key in [Figure 3-10](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#fig_column_store), it might make sense for `product_sk` to be the second sort key so that all sales for the same product on the same day are grouped together in storage. That will help queries that need to group or filter sales by product within a certain date range.",
											"Another advantage of sorted order is that it can help with compression of columns. If the primary sort column does not have many distinct values, then after sorting, it will have long sequences where the same value is repeated many times in a row. A simple run-length encoding, like we used for the bitmaps in [Figure 3-11](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#fig_bitmap_index), could compress that column down to a few kilobytes—even if the table has billions of rows.",
											"That compression effect is strongest on the first sort key. The second and third sort keys will be more jumbled up, and thus not have such long runs of repeated values. Columns further down the sorting priority appear in essentially random order, so they probably won’t compress as well. But having the first few columns sorted is still a win overall.",
											"### **Several different sort orders**",
											"A clever extension of this idea was introduced in C-Store and adopted in the commercial data warehouse Vertica \\[[61](), [62]()\\]. Different queries benefit from different sort orders, so why not store the same data sorted in *several different* ways? Data needs to be replicated to multiple machines anyway, so that you don’t lose data if one machine fails. You might as well store that redundant data sorted in different ways so that when you’re processing a query, you can use the version that best fits the query pattern.",
											"Having multiple sort orders in a column-oriented store is a bit similar to having multiple secondary indexes in a row-oriented store. But the big difference is that the row-oriented store keeps every row in one place (in the heap file or a clustered index), and secondary indexes just contain pointers to the matching rows. In a column store, there normally aren’t any pointers to data elsewhere, only columns containing values.",
										],
										initial:

Administrators choose sort keys, like date_key for date range queries and product_sk for organizing similar dates. Sorting aids compression, particularly for primary sort keys with repeated values, though the effect lessens with lower-priority columns. Systems like C-Store and Vertica enhance performance by storing data in multiple sort orders, optimizing for diverse query patterns through data replication.

For instance, if you’re always asking about date ranges, you’d use a date_key. Or, if you want to group similar dates, product_sk might be your go-to. This sorting not only speeds up access but also makes your data smaller, thanks to better compression. Especially when you have primary sort keys with lots of repeated values, it’s like squeezing a sponge dry.",

											"Another aspect of data warehouses that is worth mentioning briefly is *materialized aggregates*. As discussed earlier, data warehouse queries often involve an aggregate function, such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, or `MAX` in SQL. If the same aggregates are used by many different queries, it can be wasteful to crunch through the raw data every time. Why not cache some of the counts or sums that queries use most often?",
											"One way of creating such a cache is a *materialized view*. In a relational data model, it is often defined like a standard (virtual) view: a table-like object whose contents are the results of some query. The difference is that a materialized view is an actual copy of the query results, written to disk, whereas a virtual view is just a shortcut for writing queries. When you read from a virtual view, the SQL engine expands it into the view’s underlying query on the fly and then processes the expanded query.",
											"When the underlying data changes, a materialized view needs to be updated, because it is a denormalized copy of the data. The database can do that automatically, but such updates make writes more expensive, which is why materialized views are not often used in OLTP databases. In read-heavy data warehouses they can make more sense (whether or not they actually improve read performance depends on the individual case).",
											"A common special case of a materialized view is known as a *data cube* or *OLAP cube* \\[[64]()\\]. It is a grid of aggregates grouped by different dimensions. [Figure 3-12](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#fig_data_cube) shows an example.",

You can now draw a two-dimensional table, with dates along one axis and products along the other. Each cell contains the aggregate (e.g., `SUM`) of an attribute (e.g., `net_price`) of all facts with that date-product combination. Then you can apply the same aggregate along each row or column and get a summary that has been reduced by one dimension (the sales by product regardless of date, or the sales by date regardless of product).",

In [Figure 3-9](blob:https://johnfactotum.github.io/faa0281e-3579-4962-b436-619702d86151#fig_dwh_schema) there are five dimensions: date, product, store, promotion, and customer. It’s a lot harder to imagine what a five-dimensional hypercube would look like, but the principle remains the same: each cell contains the sales for a particular date-product-store-promotion-customer combination. These values can then repeatedly be summarized along each of the dimensions.",

For example, if you want to know the total sales per store yesterday, you just need to look at the totals along the appropriate dimension—no need to scan millions of rows.",

For example, there is no way of calculating which proportion of sales comes from items that cost more than $100, because the price isn’t one of the dimensions.

								"* OLTP systems are typically user-facing, which means that they may see a huge volume of requests. In order to handle the load, applications usually only touch a small number of records in each query. The application requests records using some kind of key, and the storage engine uses an index to find the data for the requested key. Disk seek time is often the bottleneck here.",
								"* Data warehouses and similar analytic systems are less well known, because they are primarily used by business analysts, not by end users. They handle a much lower volume of queries than OLTP systems, but each query is typically very demanding, requiring many millions of records to be scanned in a short time. Disk bandwidth (not seek time) is often the bottleneck here, and column-oriented storage is an increasingly popular solution for this kind of workload.",
								"On the OLTP side, we saw storage engines from two main schools of thought:",

								"* The update-in-place school, which treats the disk as a set of fixed-size pages that can be overwritten. B-trees are the biggest example of this philosophy, being used in all major relational databases and also many nonrelational ones.",
								"Log-structured storage engines are a comparatively recent development. Their key idea is that they systematically turn random-access writes into sequential writes on disk, which enables higher write throughput due to the performance characteristics of hard drives and SSDs.",
								"Finishing off the OLTP side, we did a brief tour through some more complicated indexing structures, and databases that are optimized for keeping all data in memory.",
								"We then took a detour from the internals of storage engines to look at the high-level architecture of a typical data warehouse. This background illustrated why analytic workloads are so different from OLTP: when your queries require sequentially scanning across a large number of rows, indexes are much less relevant. Instead it becomes important to encode data very compactly, to minimize the amount of data that the query needs to read from disk. We discussed how column-oriented storage helps achieve this goal.",

								"Databases are like the unsung heroes of the digital world, quietly managing the chaos of data storage and retrieval. At the heart of this are two heavyweights: OLTP and OLAP systems.",
								"OLTP, or Online Transaction Processing, is your go-to for handling a high volume of small, rapid-fire data requests. Imagine a busy checkout line at a grocery store, where each transaction needs to be processed quickly and efficiently. Here, disk seek time is the bottleneck, meaning the speed at which data is fetched from the disk can slow things down. To tackle this, OLTP systems might use log-structured engines like Bitcask, or update-in-place engines like B-trees, to keep things snappy.",
								"On the flip side, we have OLAP, or Online Analytical Processing. This is where the heavy lifting of data analysis happens. OLAP systems are built for fewer, but far more complex queries, akin to a data scientist sifting through mountains of data to uncover insights. Here, the bottleneck is disk bandwidth—how fast data can be read from the disk. To optimize, these systems often use column-oriented storage, which is perfect for scanning large datasets quickly.",
								"Grasping the differences between OLTP and OLAP is crucial for developers. It’s like choosing the right tool for the job—whether you’re optimizing for speed in transactions or efficiency in analytics, understanding these systems helps you make informed decisions about which database tools to use and how to get the best performance out of them.",

Understanding these engines aids developers in choosing the right tools and optimizing database performance for specific applications.",

					"Database storage and retrieval—it's where the magic happens. On one side, we've got OLTP, or Online Transaction Processing. It's all about handling high-volume, small-data queries like a boss. Think of it like a speedster, optimized with log-structured methods, such as LSM-trees. These are data structures that excel at handling write-heavy workloads by keeping things organized in a sequential manner.",
					"On the other side of the ring, there's OLAP, or Online Analytical Processing. This heavyweight champ is built for large, complex queries. Imagine column-oriented storage systems that slice and dice data for breakfast. They focus on reading massive amounts of data efficiently, perfect for analytics and data warehousing.",
					"Now, let's talk about indexing. Enter B-trees, the classic data structure that balances data across nodes for efficient searching. They're like the librarians of the database world, helping you find what you need quickly. But here's the catch—there's always a trade-off between read and write performance. Optimizing for one can impact the other.",
					"Understanding these storage engines is crucial. It helps developers pick the right tool for the job and optimize database performance tailored to specific applications. Whether you're building a high-frequency trading platform or a data analytics powerhouse, knowing the ins and outs of OLTP and OLAP can make all the difference.",
